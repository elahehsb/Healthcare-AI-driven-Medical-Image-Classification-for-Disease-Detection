# Healthcare-AI-driven-Medical-Image-Classification-for-Disease-Detection

### Project Overview
Medical image classification is a critical task in healthcare, aiding in the early detection and diagnosis of diseases. This project involves developing a deep learning model to classify medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) to detect diseases such as pneumonia, brain tumors, or skin cancer.

### Project Goals
##### Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a dataset of labeled medical images, preprocess the images.
##### Model Development: Create a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the medical images.
##### Model Training: Train the model on the labeled dataset of medical images.
##### Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
##### Deployment: Develop a web application to upload medical images and get disease diagnoses.


### Steps for Implementation
1. Data Collection
Use publicly available datasets such as:

    ###### Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia): Available on Kaggle.
    ###### ISIC 2018: Skin cancer detection dataset.
    ###### Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection: Available on Kaggle.
2. Data Preprocessing
    ###### Normalization: Normalize pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.
    ###### Resizing: Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224).
    ###### Data Augmentation: Apply random transformations like rotations, flips, and zooms to increase the diversity of the training set.
3. Model Development
Develop a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.

4. Model Training
Split the dataset into training and validation sets, then train the model.

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. Deployment
Deploy the model using Flask for the backend and a simple HTML/CSS frontend.
